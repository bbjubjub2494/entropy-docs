# Key Resharing

* The concept here is that as validators enter and exit the network their key shares should become unvalidated 
* This is still being designed but the key concept is that on a specified amount of time the chain will trigger a key resharing process
* this will consist of the nodes getting together and reblinding their keys
* the user's key will remain active and unblinded but all old keys will now be invalid
* There may also be an individual trigger for a forced reblinding generated by the user

# Key Resharing

- The concept here is that as validators enter and exit the network their key shares should become unvalidated
- This is still being designed but the key concept is that on a specified amount of time the chain will trigger a key resharing process
- this will consist of the nodes getting together and reblinding their keys
- the user's key will remain active and unblinded but all old keys will now be invalid
- There may also be an individual trigger for a forced reblinding generated by the user

## Key Resharing but I asked ChatGPT3 to make it sound like a Doctor Seuss book.

In a network so fun and bright,
Validators come and go with might.
But as they leave and then return,
Their key shares start to yearn.

A plan we have, still in our heads,
To make these keys, unvalidated, as said.
With a trigger, set for a time,
The chain will call, "It's key reshare time!"

The nodes will gather, with such glee,
And reblinding, is what they will see.
Your key remains, active and bright,
But old keys now, are out of sight!

And if you wish, with just a flick,
A forced reblinding, you can pick.
So join us now, in this big game,
Where key resharing is never the same!

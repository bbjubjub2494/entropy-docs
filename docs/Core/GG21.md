# GG21

- TODO for Bogdan

<!-- From peg's notes: -->
<!-- Entropy currently uses [tofn](https://github.com/entropyxyz/tofn) - an implementation of the [2020 Gennaro and Goldfelder scheme - GG20](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/540.pdf) - which is to be replaced by [cggmp21](https://github.com/entropyxyz/cggmp21) - an implementation of the [2021 Canetti-Gennaro-Goldfeder-Makriyannis-Peled scheme](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/060) - which is under active development. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- - 'Identifiable aborts' refers to being able to reveal which party has misbehaved when the signing protocol fails. -->
<!-- - [Presentation on the CGGMP21 scheme from Nikolaos Makriyannis](https://www.nist.gov/video/mpts-2020-talk-3a3-uc-non-interactive-proactive-threshold-ecdsa-identifiable-aborts), [presentation of GG20 from Steven Goldfelder](https://youtu.be/wtxH3PuMAgQ) -->
<!-- - GG20 requires 8 rounds of communication to sign, CGGMP21 either 4 or 7 (depending on the computation / communication trade-off chosen).  -->
<!-- - With CGGMP21, only the final round of the signing protocol requires knowledge of the message. The other rounds are known as the 'pre-signing' phase.  -->

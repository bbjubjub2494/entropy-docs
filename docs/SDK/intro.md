# Intro

Documentation for [Entropy's Software Development Kit](https://github.com/entropyxyz/entropy-js).

The SDK is run by a user (for example as part of wallet software) to communicate with both an Entropy chain node over websocket, and threshold servers over HTTP.

Entropy's SDK is based off multiple classes containing functionality for using the Entropy network. All classes can be spun up individually for power users, or for quick use an [`Entropy`](./Core) class bundles all of them together and creates more complex functions for making entropy network use easy.
